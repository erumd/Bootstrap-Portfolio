<h1>Responsive Portfolio</h1>

I used a responsive design to make a webpage that loads on different devices of different screen sizes.  This included having working link to different pages on the same web browser. I also made sure images loaded fully. I used Bootstrap CSS framework to create portfolio and Visual Studio Tool.
